Title: Euclid "Dark Universe" Probe De-Iced Successfully
Summary: The European Space Agency successfully de-iced the Euclid telescope, restoring its vision by heating one mirror from a million miles away. The experiment removed ice layers as thin as a DNA strand, allowing the telescope to capture 15% more starlight. The de-icing procedure can be repeated every 6-12 months.
