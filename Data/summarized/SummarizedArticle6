Title: The Universe Could Be Younger Than We Thought

Summary: Recent observations of satellite galaxies suggest that the universe may be younger than the 13.8 billion years estimated by the Planck mission. The movements of satellite pairs contradict current models, hinting at a possible flaw in the Standard Model of cosmology. This discovery may help resolve the "Hubble tension" paradox.
